# VAT Calculator
A VAT calculator for when you need to calculae the VAT on a payment, but only part of the payment is VATable.

## How to use
### Multiple VAT Calculator
 - Run the program
 - When prompted, input the invoice/receipt total (including VAT)
 - When prompted, input all the values subject to 20% VAT separated by a comma and a space (', '). If there are no values subject to 20% VAT, type 'none'.
 - When prompted, input all the values subject to 5% VAT separated by a comma and a space (', '). If there are no values subject to 5% VAT, type 'none'.
 - The program will then calculate the VAT value for both 20 and 5% VAT, the goods total, the total VAT, and double check that the VAT calculation has worked properly. For convenience, it will also display the total of the invoice again.

### Old version
 - Edit 'inv_value; to store the total value of the invoice/receipt
 - Edit 'numbers' to store a list of the values subject to 20% VAT
 - Run the program
 - The program will calculate the VAT on the values subject to it, as well as the goods total, and will check that the VAT calculation worked properly. For convenience, it will also display the total of the invoice again.

## Context
This project was started after my first month of learning Python in order to put my self-teaching to practical use, and I have continued to rework it as I have learnt more. 'Old_Version' preserves the system I wrote after two months of learning, and 'multiple_vat_calculator' preserves the most recent version, created after around five months of learning.
